# Medal Clip That With Alexa
Clip your gameplay using Alexa!!
This VickiScript is designed to simulate pressing the F8 key when the phrase "clip that" is heard.
# Usage
This script listens for the phrase "clip that" and simulates pressing the F8 key on the keyboard.

# How does it work??
The script utilizes the VickiScript framework to listen for "clip that". Upon hearing this phrase, it triggers the simulation of pressing the F8 key using native keyboard functionality. Additionally, it responds to the user with an empty string, providing a silent confirmation of the action.

# Why not use Medal.tv voice-activated feature?
In short, it sucks... It's unreliable and prone to errors. Using it with alexa has been a flawless experience!
